# Minmus
## A **min**imal **m**utexed **u**ser-data **s**torage library 

This library is a small and maybe useful example of some interesting parts of the rust language.
In it you'll find the use of structs, enumerations, traits, generics, and a few other things. 

To get started run the following commands: 

```
    cargo doc
    cargo build --examples
```

Once this is complete, open *target/doc/minmus/index.html* to see the auto generated documentation for the library.
