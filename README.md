This library is a small and maybe useful example of some interesting parts of the rust language.
In it you'll find the use of structs, enumerations, traits, generics, and a few other things. 

To get started run the following commands: 

```
    cargo doc
    cargo build --examples
```

Once this is complete, open *target/doc/minmus/index.html* to see the auto generated documentation for the library.

When you feel satisfied with reading documentation, you can check out the example by running the example application you built here:  *target/debug/examples/basic_usage*
